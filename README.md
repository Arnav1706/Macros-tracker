# Macros-tracker
This script will be able to calculate all the macros, vitamins and minerals you consume everyday

Requirements: The user would need to install python along with the libraries used on their device

Installing python :- Go to the microsoft store and search for python and install it

The user will need to add the weight of all the ingredients to calculate the macros. The user can also change the code according to their liking. They can change the nutrient content for each food. I have made this according to the products I consume everyday. The minerals and vitamins calculated are in miligrams while the macros are calculated in grams. New food items can also be added according to the convinience of user. All the nutrients here are set for 100g of food items. However for items like almonds, cashews, etc it's calculated per piece and for liquid products, it's per 100 ml
